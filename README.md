This scans UserIDs for rule-breaking assets. 
This program will not damage your computer, however I am not responsible for any accusations based on my application. This application is very new and results may be inaccurate, the application is currently open-sourced, DO NOT USE FOR MALICIOUS PURPOSES. This CAN damage your computer if used incorrectly so follow the document-steps in the rest of the folder. I do not condone to any damage done to your computer, or someoneâ€™s reputation. This application is very new and results are not serious nor accurate. Other features will be added in the future in order to provide accurate results. I am currently teaming up with Roblox support to battle moderation on the platform, and all credits must go to me if remade or forked. This application is a moderation tool that is used by Roblox itself, if there are any inaccurate results contact me via email or discord, email: stylesonrblx@gmail.com, discord: stylesonrblx. If contacting, provide a screenshot of syntax error/other errors/ or inaccurate results to be patched. This program is still new, do not expect perfection please.
